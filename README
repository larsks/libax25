AX25 Library
============

This library set is still really under test but is now release for
general use.

You are supposed to use glibc 2.1 (libc6 unstable libraries) for this
package.  I have attempted to cater for glibc 2.0 users here.

This library is copyright by the respective authors (see AUTHORS for a list)
and licensed under the GNU LGPL (see COPYING for more information).
